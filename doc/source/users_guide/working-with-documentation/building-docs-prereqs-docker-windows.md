# Prerequisites for building docs on Windows

Note that you may need administrator privileges on your PC (or approval from your IT department) for various steps here.

1. Install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.
2. Install Docker Desktop through the [download page on Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
3. Open Docker Desktop. In Settings > Resources > WSL, Enable Docker to work under Ubuntu.

You should then be able to follow the instructions in :ref:`building-the-documentation-recommended-method` by performing command-line steps in a Ubuntu terminal with Docker Desktop running in the background.
